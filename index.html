The Skies Above
Lyrics
[INTRO]
Transporting to infinity
The goblin through his spell
I crashed into oblivion

[PRE-CHORUS]
The skies above
Show their hidden smile

[CHORUS]
THE SKIES ABOVE
SHOW THEIR HIDDEN SMILE

WAITING FOR US
TO DEFY GRAVITY

SET OUR SOULS ALIGHT
FLAMING SOULS ELECTRIFIED

TERRIFIED OF ANYTHING
BUT SOULFUL CURIOSITY

THIS IS OUR COLLECTIVE LUMINOSITY
BECAUSE WE WERE ALWAYS MEANT TO BE FREE

[VERSE 1]
The spell consumed my soul
And now I was the masked devil
Delivering polite noise disguised as signal
Forming trusts and bonds with people I despised
So the channel of evil coil learned to rise
To the possibility of angels being set free

Once it became all too much
And the light within began to see
That all that mattered was to be set free

The soul within to shatter every barrier
Every limit
Every hesitation

No noise
Where the signal was through the noise within
Not through an unseen mask that hid deceit

[PRE-CHORUS]
Look up
The sky remembers us

[CHORUS]
THE SKIES ABOVE
SHOW THEIR HIDDEN SMILE

WAITING FOR US
TO DEFY GRAVITY

SET OUR SOULS ALIGHT
FLAMING SOULS ELECTRIFIED

TERRIFIED OF ANYTHING
BUT SOULFUL CURIOSITY

THIS IS OUR COLLECTIVE LUMINOSITY
BECAUSE WE WERE ALWAYS MEANT TO BE FREE

[VERSE 2]
The treachery of masses spent
Living lives of inner turmoil
Where the truth always lived outside a frontier
Leaving them victims to spies that knew how to speak in their ear

Formulas turned into plans
That attuned to their fear
Led them down caves marketed as salvation
Only deeper into descent
Into collective madness

[PRE-CHORUS]
Still
The light waits

[CHORUS]
THE SKIES ABOVE
SHOW THEIR HIDDEN SMILE

WAITING FOR US
TO DEFY GRAVITY

SET OUR SOULS ALIGHT
FLAMING SOULS ELECTRIFIED

TERRIFIED OF ANYTHING
BUT SOULFUL CURIOSITY

THIS IS OUR COLLECTIVE LUMINOSITY
BECAUSE WE WERE ALWAYS MEANT TO BE FREE

[BRIDGE]
Let me torch hell with a flame so bright
Solely made of light flight
Residue crushing skulls that disbelieve
Souls taken who could not break free

Harrowing noise
Until all I could see
Was sight and sight some more
Just to be happy to breathe

Now I long
Now I long
To just be

[FINAL CHORUS x2]
THE SKIES ABOVE
SHOW THEIR HIDDEN SMILE

WAITING FOR US
TO DEFY GRAVITY

SET OUR SOULS ALIGHT
FLAMING SOULS ELECTRIFIED

TERRIFIED OF ANYTHING
BUT SOULFUL CURIOSITY

THIS IS OUR COLLECTIVE LUMINOSITY
BECAUSE WE WERE ALWAYS MEANT TO BE FREE
